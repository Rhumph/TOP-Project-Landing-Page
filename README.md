This is the first major project from The Odin Projects currciculum that uses both HTML and CSS.

All that has been provided is an image of the website that it should look like, some of the key apsects I will do are listed below.

-Create GitHub repository
-Create all the documents for the website page (HTML, CSS)
-Design the web page from the image
-git branch management

I also made an interesting situation for myself when I decided to add an image to the GitHub repository on the web while i was working on it remotely. This caused there to be two seperate branches that I had to reconcile through a 'git merge' & 'git pull' command. Amazingly I got it to work correctly first go and could continue working on.
